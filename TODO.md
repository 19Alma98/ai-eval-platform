# TODO

Open items from the RAG evaluation review (2026-10-08). Fixed items are in git history.

## Tooling

- [ ] **No frontend `test` script.** Unit tests use `node:test` and only run with
  `node --import tsx --test <files>`. Add `"test"` to `frontend/package.json` and run it in CI.


## Performance

Deferred until list latency, DB pool pressure, or large projects make them hurt.
Do not block feature work on these. When optimizing, do N+1 batching first, then
`failed_only` denormalization (batching alone does not remove O(N) failed_only scans).

- [ ] **Live list N+1.** `ListLiveInteractions` loads scores and review per row (~3 queries ×
  page size; default 50, polled every 5s). Batch-load scores and reviews for a page.
  Fix when: list feels slow or query volume / pool wait shows up under normal browsing.
- [ ] **`failed_only` can scan the whole project** when few interactions failed (pages through all
  rows). Persist the verdict per interaction (e.g. `has_failed_score`) at scoring time and filter in
  SQL. Fix when: thousands+ interactions and the filter is used often (or empty full scans hurt).
  Do not replace with a fixed recent window — older failures must still surface.
